## About

* @ Context
	* Obsidian note taking
* @ Problem/Value/Solution [PVS]
	* I don't use folders to organize notes. This creates situations where I am 300 files deep into my vault--scrolling up to check on some of the folders is arduous. This plugin scrolls to the top of the [file explorer](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/file-explorer).
